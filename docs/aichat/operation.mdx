# Operation

PlayChat checks on failed dialogs, and learns through them in order to provide operation management functions that enable chatbots smarter communications. In "Operation" -> "User menu", we provide the function of showcasing the information about the users that have interacted with the chatbot. In "Operation" -> "Failed dialogs", it is possible to read failed dialogs and provides the developers functions that teach the chatbot using the failed dialogs.

## Learning from failed dialog

There are three ways for the chatbot to learn from a failed dialog. Dialog sets, dialog scenarios, and intents.

### 1. Dialog Sets
Shows the failed dialog based on frequency.
<p align="center">
<img src="/img/aichat/operation-dialogsets.png" />
</p>

Recommends the questions that are part of the failed dialogs and some other similar questions that are already learned among previous dialog sets.

</p>

Once the response of the failed dialog is entered, the program will recommend a similar response.

</p>

Click on "ignore" to delete the relevant failed dialog from the failed dialog list.

### 2. Dialog Scenarios
Shows the failed dialog based on frequency.

In a list, shows the card of the position when the dialog failed, user inputs that were never matched, and frequencies.

</p>

Click on the "Go to dialog scenario" button to create a descendant card of the card in position when the dialog failed.

Click on "ignore" to delete the relevant failed dialog from the failed dialog list.

### 3. Intents
In an intensive analysis dialog study, the program gathers the intents whenever a dialog had failed.

Some failed intents appear as the "recommended". Click on the edit dialog button on the right for the failed intents to show up. Check and add some of the failed and recommended intents for them to be updated.

Dialog scenarios are scenario graphs in the form of trees, and are tools that assist the user to create and edit a chatbot. It is divided into a scenario tab, and a function workspace tab. To use a dialog scenario, click on "Develop" -> "Dialog Scenarios" on the navigation bar.
