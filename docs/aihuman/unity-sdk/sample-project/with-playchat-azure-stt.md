# with Playchat & Azure STT

:::caution

This part is under construction.
You'll be able to see it soon.

:::

This menu is an example of a Conversational AI service that integrates AI Human, PlayChat and Microsoft Azure STT. Basically, AI Human and Playchat are in the form of chatting by the user inputting with the keyboard. Additionally, use Azure STT to **speak like a real person**. When the AI load is complete, the AI greets you. ("Hello, long time no see.") 

After the greeting, chat or click the STT button at the bottom to get a voice input signal, say "**where are you**". (Actual operation is possible after the Azure STT setup is completed. It is explained below in this chapter.) The AI understands the voice and the AI gives an appropriate answer. Currently, as it is a test chatbot, it can answer only a few limited questions, but if the chatbot is advanced, it can be used in various ways, such as ordering at a restaurant or making a reservation for a performance depending on the situation. In addition, the chatbot can also display images by sending **additional information** in addition to text.
