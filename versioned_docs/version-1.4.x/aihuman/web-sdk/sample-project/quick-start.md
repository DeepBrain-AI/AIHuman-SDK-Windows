:::

On the quickStart page, it initializes AIPlayer to automatically load the default AI. Once the loading completes, AI will be able to speak. It may take several minutes until it is ready to speak depending on the network conditions, as there is resource loading time. After the AI is loaded, you can press the button at the top on the screen to make the AI speak a sentence.

On left top, there are 2 buttons that make AI speak with the Button's title. Click it and check how the AI speak the sentence. This is the very basic example.
